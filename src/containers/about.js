                            I spent 10 years working as a nurse in the world. I worked a lot in France in a special unit called SAMU, which stands for Emergency Medical Service in french. I spent most of my time working there, but I also worked for an international NGO called Doctors Without Borders for a couple of years, where I was a headnurse (doing operational and HR management) on the field in Ha√Æti, Nigeria and South Sudan.

                            But since my childhood, I've been practicing programming, as a hobby! I've always loved that and over the years, I particularly trained for web development.
