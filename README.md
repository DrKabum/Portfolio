# Hi, I'm Nicolas Broca
I'm a new comer in the dev industry and I'm trying to showcase some of my skills! I'm operating a career change, from nursing to web dev. How does it sound to you? Probably a bit surprising. Although, many people do that all the time, it's always a little surprising to see that from someone, especially for a recruter I guess. This website is my personal portfolio, and I hope it will be useful to anyone interested or anoyone who is trying to gauge my abilities and my motivations.

# About the website
It's all React. I'm using functional components, hooks, even custom ones and my components are designed in a composition pattern, so they are easily reusable and customisable accros different places. 

# Other libraries
A this time of development, I'm using :
* [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) : For the creation of [RFC4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUIDs. Useful to create strong random numbers for `key` of some elements, and maybe later on for strong cryptographically random values.
* [FontAwesome for React](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react) : Font Awesome is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators.
